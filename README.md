# readme-generator

### Description:

This uses the [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) Node Package to prompt the user for details in order to generate a ReadMe for one of their GitHub repositories. It also leverages the [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) Node Package to send an AJAX call to the GitHub API to get the user's avatar, github email and url.
Fun fact: I made the basic version of this readme file using this app! Disclaimer: I edited it afterwards.

### Installation:

Once you clone the repo, run npm install in the command line to install the required dependencies (i.e. inquirer and axios).
Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

### Usage:

Once the app is set up, run node index.js and answer the questions to generate your readme. The only thing that breaks the app is if the username entered doesn't match one found on GitHub. But don't worry! You can just run node index.js again to retry. 

### Final Thoughts:
I'm still getting used to ES6 syntax, but I found this pretty straightforward logic-wise. I prefer working with the DOM instead of the command line, even though I find it somewhat difficult.
